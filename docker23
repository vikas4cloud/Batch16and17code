Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 
 
 
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs th
e
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent
 it
    to your terminal.
